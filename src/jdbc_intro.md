# The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)

The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API is the industry standard for database-independent connectivity between the Java programming language and a wide range of databases.
The JDBC API makes it possible to do three things:
* Establish a connection with a database or access any tabular data source;
* Send SQL statements;
* Process the results;

Different database vendors provide various JDBC drivers to support their applications to different databases.

Generally, JDBC API enables users to access virtually any kind of tabular data source, such as spreadsheets or flat files from a Java application. It also provides connectivity to a wide scope of SQL or Oracle databases.
